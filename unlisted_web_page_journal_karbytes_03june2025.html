<p>Apparently (according to my current frame of reference), many people are heckling me in order to get me to write a note like this one. I think if I write it (and &#8220;redact&#8221; most of it) that will (at least temporarily) ease some of the tension those people feel. Here it goes&#8230;</p>
<p>For as far back as I can remember, I have always felt strongly that each human being has the same &#8220;amount&#8221; of societal worth as every other human being which ever exists. In other words, my core identity as far back as I can remember is being unwaveringly egalitarian. <span style="background:#000000;color:#000000">This is especially pertinent to the category of gender. To my dismay, however, it seemed that many people (especially people older than me) thought I was abnormal for being so indifferent to the polarizing categories those &#8220;authority figures&#8221; insisted on exaggerating and getting extremely emotional about. Those &#8220;authorities&#8221; (and their loyal &#8220;minions&#8221;) seemed to think it was their job to intervene and force me to assimilate to their anti-egalitarianism.</span></p>
<p>If I have ever come across as bigoted <span style="background:#000000;color:#000000">(especially in the form of misogyny and favoritism of men (especially able-bodied, light-skinned, affluent, and socially high-ranking))</span>, I think I was most likely was in &#8220;deep fake&#8221; role-play for the sake of avoiding being the target of unfavorable treatment (from people other than myself).</p>
<p><span style="background:#000000;color:#000000">To hurry up and &#8220;get to the point&#8221;, I&#8217;m apparently supposed to act as though men and boys are &#8220;supposed to&#8221; be treated as being more valuable to society and significantly more deserving of affluence, respect, admiration, fame, being taken seriously, and enjoying personal space and solitude than women and girls. I&#8217;m apparently &#8220;supposed to&#8221; act as though I sincerely believe there is absolutely no viable alternative to that arrangement and that girls and women are just supposed to feel more oppressed, terrorized, belittled, bullied, surveilled, infantilized, and physically violated than men. Such acting seems to only reinforce and normalize the dehumanization of female humans and the exaltation and worshiping of male humans. Such acting seems to be what is most popular for humans to do throughout the entire space-time continuum in which humans ever existed (except for a few relatively tiny &#8220;bubbles&#8221; of relatively egalitarian communities where men and women are automatically treated as being of the same essential class and function with respect to society).</span></p>
<p>Those pressuring me to write this note are seemingly not happy so far. I haven&#8217;t even covered what they want me to yet. How about I hurry up and pretend to be a model citizen and caricaturize that?</p>
<p><span style="background:#000000;color:#000000">&#8220;All anyone takes interest in women and girls for is (a) the size and shape of their breasts and buttocks, (b) how receptive and prepared they look to accommodate a man&#8217;s sexual and reproductive urges, and (c) how loyal and compliant they appear to be thinking and behaving with respect to the all-mighty patriarchy. Anything else is just to accommodate the whiny special snowflake communist liberals who regrettably got to have some say over how the government and businesses operate. Yes, I know it sucks, but we gotta sometimes placate the weaker, dumber folks with flattering lies so that they don&#8217;t file a lawsuit against us. We never sincerely compliment the females on anything other than (a), (b), (c).&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="background:#000000;color:#000000">&#8220;I don&#8217;t want karbytes to focus on anything other than how oppressed and emasculated they think women are. I like how karbytes is always in distress over feminist crap instead having fun and being chill like the rest of us. We don&#8217;t have to show off. karbytes acts like they&#8217;re never done with anything. It&#8217;s like they never complete anything. It&#8217;s like they&#8217;re never satisfied no matter how much they stress and strive and strain. We ought to denigrate karbytes for acting so arrogant, ambitious, crabby, hyperactive, hyper-intellectual, and dysphoric about the status quo. The world revolves around patriarchy and most women don&#8217;t fight against being man-handled in body and mind. In fact, most girls seem to love it when a man takes possession of their bodies, minds, bank accounts, and lives (and property too). All a woman really wants and needs is a man&#8217;s protection, provisions, and micromanagement of her (so she doesn&#8217;t have to think and, instead, just relax and enjoy always being under supervision and confined to patriarchal institutions which protect her from becoming corrupt by external or independent agendas).&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="background:#000000;color:#000000">&#8220;The women in prison don&#8217;t have access to a gym, basketball court, or outdoor recess yard like the male inmates do at the same prison. That&#8217;s because girls are supposed to be lazy fat cows who would much rather watch and lust over the boys on the other side of the cages showing off their ripped shirtless upper bodies while the girls look like they are on indefinitely long maternity leave (on strict bed rest).&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="background:#000000;color:#000000">&#8220;It&#8217;s vain for a woman to exercise and to commute without being inside of an enclosed or motorized vehicle. She needs to save her precious energy and cherished fat stores to spontaneously give into a man&#8217;s lust-filled urges to fill her with his seed and to treat her as irreparably damaged goods if someone else&#8217;s dick enters her afterwards. She&#8217;s not supposed to look too sexy after we make her exclusively our cow to fuck and make birth our heirs. That&#8217;s to show other men she&#8217;s taken. Before she gets pregnant, she&#8217;s supposed to have a relatively small waist but well padded buttocks and breasts (which are perky and round instead of saggy or flat) because such are the ephemeral signs she&#8217;s ready to be impregnated by The One And Only; the first Man to successfully claim her for Himself and make her dance to His whims forever after. Then, once she&#8217;s beset with children who keep her perpetually too busy and exhausted to do anything but take care of them (and their Father, of course) we need not worry that she&#8217;ll leave or become more financially self-sufficient than us. Fatherhood makes us even more powerful. We don&#8217;t have to take time off work for childcare duties nor stop indulging in the activities we enjoyed as teenagers and young adults.&#8221;</span></p>

<p>I honestly think there is some kind of mass cult of people acting in ways I (and even them) think is obnoxious, ugly, unnecessary, and hopelessly and zealously petty. <span style="background:#000000;color:#000000">No offense, I see more women than men acting like attention whores pretending to be dumb, funny, and excessively vocal and babyish sounding. I hate how they act like they cannot handle quietude nor solitude and insist on polluting such things with their trashy and creepy antics (like they insist on being treated as preschool-aged kids that never outgrow that level of intellectual and moral sophistication). And when I listen to their actual words, they seem to hardly be dispensing any actual content; just repetitive and uninteresting and unnecessary babbling. I cannot help but suspect that such seemingly normal female behavior is secretly a psychotic outburst in response to their horrifying predicaments of essentially having been drugged, raped, and made to sleepwalk through life in a horrifically dumbed down and unattractive role with little in the way of meaningful accomplishments besides being a good cuck to the patriarchy which births babies and sucks dick on command.</span></p>
<p>* * *</p>
<p>I honestly feel that I&#8217;m in a bit of a &#8220;no-win situation&#8221; with respect to what I&#8217;ve disclosed in this note. In other words, everything I do (no matter what it is) seems to be treated by &#8220;society&#8221; as being &#8220;bad behavior&#8221;.</p>
<p>If I do everything in my power to adhere to my ethical convictions (even if others people think such convictions are commendable), other people complain that I am &#8220;trying too hard&#8221; to make myself look and feel good instead of what is implicitly favored: that I not be any more self-disciplined and successful than whoever else I live with or next to. <span style="background:#000000;color:#000000">That seems to be why most people are in some kind of rut and dissociative state instead of more acutely aware of how everything is interconnected and how their &#8220;choices&#8221; affect the physical universe.</span></p>
<p><span style="background:#000000;color:#000000">I did not enjoy writing this, but I figured that it was not a waste of my time to do so (especially if this note definitively suffices for covering The Dilemma I felt obliged to address).</span></p>
<p>How to proceed from here? I tell myself to simply take as isolationist and non-interventionist of an approach to social matters as I can stand. I&#8217;ll just tell people I&#8217;m a selfish loner who just wants to play with its toys and go on long walks for the rest of my life and that I&#8217;m okay with being poor, condemned, unpopular, misunderstood, and even in painful or dangerous predicaments (especially because I chose to go it alone and to do it my way instead of someone else&#8217;s way).</p>
<p>* * *</p>
<p>To be honest I seem to be the target of a certain kind of harassment on a daily basis. <span style="background:#000000;color:#000000">Without revealing any person&#8217;s identity but my own, I will admit now that I think there are a few chauvinist pigs who seem to spend a ridiculously large percentage of their time trying to upset me in ways which feel like intrusions upon my personal space and desperate attempts to assert dominance over me.</span> I&#8217;ve had a few too many personal items mysteriously go missing around times such people have been seemingly waiting to catch me off guard while they check on me and likely tamper with my personal property when I&#8217;m not looking.</p>
<p>Without revealing more information than I feel comfortable releasing, I have reason to suspect that such people are habitual liars and addicted to trying to stir up drama with me. I&#8217;m simply trying not to let such antics seriously derail the progress I&#8217;m attempting to make towards my goals (especially creative and vocational endeavors). I think such people get a hit of pleasure when they think I&#8217;m in distress. Hence, they probably won&#8217;t stop anytime soon trying to keep me from being at peace (especially given that they seem to be exempt from being held accountable for their actions and presumed to always be saner and more innocent than me).</p>
