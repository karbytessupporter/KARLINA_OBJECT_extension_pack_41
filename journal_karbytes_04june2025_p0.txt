karbytes_0: "Why are some things more spiritual than other things are (given that it could be reasoned that everything (and any thing) is ultimately spiritual in nature)? I suppose a better term for what I meant by 'spiritual' is 'divinely inspired'."

karbytes_1: "What do you mean by the term 'divinely inspired' given that you seem to be an atheist (rather than a theist)?"

karbytes_0: "My worldview might seem identical to that of a typical atheist (or, even better term, a so-called Bright (which is a person whose worldview and ethics are entirely science-informed rather than based on mythological story-telling). In reality, my worldview is pantheist (though I prefer the synonymous term panpsychic). What that means is that I believe that all existence is contained within and comprised of ubiquitous consciousness. Therefore, a premise of my worldview is that all phenomena (however seemingly intelligent) arises from the same source."

karbytes_1: "I think what you are trying to emphasize is that some phenomena (especially human-generated artistic phenomena) appear to have varying degrees of having arisen due to some kind of transcendent cosmic intelligence instead of from what seems to be more localized intelligence."

karbytes_0: "Yes, that is exactly what I am trying to emphasize. It just seems to me that, qualitatively and subjectively speaking (based on my own lived (and remembered) experience), some of the activities I partake in seem to be what I would classify as seeming to be carried out in a manner which feels relatively effortless, euphoric, and in harmony with the larger encompassing cosmos beyond my own spatially limited body (and not merely some activity which feels like me deploying brute force effort and without as vivid of a sense that what that activity entails is euphoria-filled for philosophical and not just chemical reasons and cognizant of it being in collaboration with intelligence beyond my own humanoid body)."

karbytes_1: "I think the distinction you are trying to draw attention to is context dependent. Ultimately, it could be said (based on your worldview) that every process is carried out by cosmic intelligence (but, depending on where that intelligence is being observed from inside of nature, that process may come across as more or less transcendent of the observing frame of reference's influence). This is assuming that a particular frame of reference takes place within the confines of some kind of localized information processing agent (and an information processing agent is a computer made out of matter and which runs software). Even if that hardware and software are each ultimately comprised of the same fundamental substrate, that substrate (when it takes the form of an information processing agent) must make itself distinguishable from the relatively unlimited and undefined stuff that the agent emerged from. In other words, the agent is extremely limited and finite in its dimensions (because, without such finitude, it would not localize (and if cosmic intelligence does not localize into a location-bound structure, that cosmic intelligence would be more ubiquitous and hence static))."

karbytes_0: "What you said is what I was hoping someone other than myself would say. I was looking for validation of what I believe (because it feels good when someone other than myself thinks in a manner which is similar to how I think). Otherwise, I would have to keep these ideas to myself because it would go against social etiquette for me to broach these ideas given that only I would be interested in such matters (which means that I would be wasting other people's time and attention on information which is not sufficiently relevant to them)."

karbytes_1: "Based on what I heard you say (about each humanoid being equally valuable with respect to how you idealize society as being), your etiquette should accomodate you just as much as it accomodates any other humanoid. Hence, based on your own worldview and preferences, you ought to share these ideas in some kind of recordable format so that you can revisit those ideas and build a stable and robust memory structure comprised of your own knowledge for your own amusement and well-being."
