To Whom It May Concern:

I am very grateful to be alive.

I am grateful for all the things in my life. I feel that I have enjoyed a fortunate existence thus far and I have reason to believe that trend will continue for the remainder of my existence (especially as medical technologies and overall infrastructure and governance improves through an ongoing process of systematic refinement and learning via "trial and error"). I have great faith in the efficay and benevolence of my species; the human beings.

I want to tell everyone that I intend to not harbor any grudges nor animosities towards anyone (and I believe it is possible for me to be virtually animosity-free 99.99% of the time simply by using the skills and knowledge I attained via my work as a philosopher and student of nature). What I have learned thus far is that intelligence tends to become more sophisticated over time (across what is considered to be an eon (if not an eternity)).

Even if, after an eon ends and the intelligent structures within it disintegrate if not entirely disappear, my investigations into ultimate reality seem to suggest that the capacity for emergent intelligence (and anything else I consider to be worth beholding and proprietizing) is an immutable property of nature's most fundamental substrate: what I presume to be an all-encompassing and timelessly ubiquitous "field" of consciousness which is also synonymous with pure nothingness.

Sincerely,
karbytes
