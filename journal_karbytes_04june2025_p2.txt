While taking a shower today, I was thiking about a Quora dot Com post I was reading which included an image of a light shining through a human baby's head which was born without a brain in it. As I washed my hair, I felt grateful to have a highly-functional brain. I thought about how vast my knowledge is (of subject matter I am interested in and more than just a novice at) and imagined that my brain would show physical signs of such vastness and specialization of knowledge. Then I imagined having my entire brain scanned for a continuous period of time between eight hours and twenty-four hours in duration such that every brain cell, connective and insulating tissue between each brain cell, and "real-time" electrical signals (and perhaps even molecular neurotransmitters) being transmitted from one location to another location across that network of brain cells is recorded and used to construct a software replica of that entire system (within that particular window of measurement).

Perhaps several of such scans can be done while I engage in various activities or states of consciousness so that an increasingly complex and lifelike composite software model of my brain can be constructed (and archived in karbytes). That would be, more or less, like cloning my actual self (which is a symphony of nervous system activity much more than it is just some kind of genome or brainless human body which looks like it might have a brain (especially if it has hair to cover its head so no light shines through it and perhaps with robotic machine parts inside the body causing it to move and even speak (and maybe read in signals coming in through optical nerves and auditory nerves, et cetera))). To put such a software model inside of the karbytes file collection (even if that brain and brain activity replica only consists of the 24-hour scan) might be sufficient to enable those who find karbytes to build an organic or virtual intelligent agent which has a personality and skill-set (and knowledge base) which initially starts off being almost identical (if not indistinguishably identical) to what I was during the respective brain scan. Over time (and after that replica agent gets the chance to do some of its own learning and decision-making), I expect that agent would behave in a way which is quite similar to how I would behave if I were in its place.
