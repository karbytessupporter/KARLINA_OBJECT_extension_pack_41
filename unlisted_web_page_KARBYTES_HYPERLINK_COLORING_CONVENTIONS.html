<p>The following specifications pertain to each hyperlink which is displayed on any web page of the website:</p>
<p>Each of the hyperlinks which is displayed on this website has a background color or a text color which is either <strong>black</strong> (i.e. #000000), <strong>green</strong> (i.e. #00ff00), or <strong>orange</strong> (i.e. #ff9000).</p>
<p>A <strong style="background:#ff9000">hyperlink</strong> whose background color is orange and whose text color is black refers to a file which belongs to a website which karbytes did not create and which is hosted on the public World Wide Web.</p>
<p>A <strong style="background:#00ff00">hyperlink</strong> whose background color is green and whose text color is black refers to a public GitHub repository which karbytes created or to a GitHub account which karbytes created.</p>
<p>A hyperlink whose background color is black refers to a raw source code file or a raw media file which is hosted on a public karbytes-created GitHub repository (and the web page for each of such raw files displays exactly one source code or media file without any extraneous content such as hyperlinks or menu buttons).</p>
<p>An example of a <strong>source code</strong> file which karbytes created and uploaded to GitHub is the file named <a style="background:#000000;color:#00ff00" href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/karlinarayberinger/KARLINA_OBJECT_summer_2023_starter_pack/main/fibonacci_numbers.cpp" target="_blank" rel="noopener">fibonacci.cpp</a>.</p>
<p>An example of a <strong>media file</strong> which karbytes created and uploaded to GitHub is the file named <a style="background:#000000;color:#ff9000" href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/karlinarayberinger/KARLINA_OBJECT_summer_2023_starter_pack/main/cube_comprised_of_eight_equally_sized_cubes_03_may_2023.jpeg" target="_blank" rel="noopener">cube_comprised_of_eight_equally_sized_cubes_03_may_2023.jpeg</a>.</p>
<p>A <strong style="background:#000000;color:#00ff00">hyperlink</strong> whose background color is black and whose text color is green refers to (a) a source code file which karbytes is the creator of or else (b) to a web page of a WordPress website which karbytes is the creator of and such that the referenced web page is considered by karbytes to be more code-dominant than prose-dominant.</p>
<p>A <strong style="background:#000000;color:#ff9000">hyperlink</strong> whose background color is black and whose text color is orange refers to (a) a media file which karbytes is the creator of or else (b) to a web page of a WordPress website which karbytes is the creator of and such that the referenced web page is considered by karbytes to be more prose-dominant than code-dominant.</p>
